# BigWork
Crowd-sourcing platform for young workers to build the future.
[presentation](https://slides.com/vitoraraujo/deck-2/fullscreen#/) 

## We believe young people can work better than they think.
So we are building and designing the platform to show the world exactly that. 

*Using Python Flask, pure CSS and material design.*

First create a virtuaenv 


```python
 pip install virtualenv
```

then in the main folder, run the virtual environment

```pyhton

virtualenv venv

```
this will create a virtual environment and a folder called "***venv***"

then activate the environment

```python

venv bin/activate

```

to run the platform locally, do this:


```python
cd into/the/mainfolder
python app.py

```
